"Cave Express is a classic 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay and dozens of levels.
Master your pedal-powered flying machine to pick up packages from your cave-dwelling clients and drop them off at the collection point.
But beware! Mighty mastodons, terrifying pterodactyls and others would rather see you extinct."
