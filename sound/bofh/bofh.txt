           Servers Under Siege V1.61
           -------------------------
                An action game


LICENSE/DISCLAIMER:

See LICENSE.TXT. If you come across earlier versions
of BOFH consider them now being under the same
license too.


HOW TO RUN:

Simply run BOFH.EXE. It is a 32-bit Windows program
that will run on Windows 95/98/NT4/2000/ME. In theory
it runs on a 386 but at least a fast 486 or Pentium
is required for reasonably smooth gameplay. DirectX
version 2 or better is required.

BOFH requires about 5MB of memory to run.

To save high scores & screenmode configuration,
BOFH.EXE needs to be able to create files called
BOFH.HSC & BOFH.CFG in the directory from where
it was run.


THE STORY:

A group of insane activists called the "Internet
Salvation Force" has invaded a school, taking
all servers and workstations as hostages. They
don't care of human hostages so all the personnel
have been told to leave. As the BOFH, you arrive
late at work, and find the building unusually
quiet...


THE MISSION:

Enraged that the computers have been taken away
from your command, you decide to fight the
activists alone. Your goal is to reclaim the
server room at the sixth floor, but first you
must defuse the bombs the activists have placed
at network closets around the building. Search
the activists you have killed for extra weapons,
first aid kits and bomb defusing instructions.
Also seek useful tools from the building.


HOW TO PLAY:

You see your BOFH, and the surroundings from an
overhead view. Use cursor keys or mouse movement
to move forwards/backwards and to turn left/right.

Press ALT + CURSOR LEFT/RIGHT or END/PAGEDOWN to
move sideways (strafe).
Press SHIFT +  CURSOR UP/DOWN to move slowly.
Press SPACE or LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to attack.
Press ENTER or RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to change weapon.

F1-F10    - Select weapon directly:
            F1 = Fists
            F2 = CAT-5 Whip
            F3 = Drill
            F4 = Pistol
            F5 = Shotgun
            F6 = Uzi
            F7 = Grenade

            640x400 scanlines and 640x400 doublesize
ALT-ENTER - Toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode


STATUS:

The status line at the bottom of screen shows your
score, health, time until the bombs explode, number
of bombs/activists/computers remaining, and your
current weapon and ammunition left.


DEFEAT/VICTORY:

The game is lost if your BOFH dies, or if the bombs
explode. You have won if all bombs have been defused,
the leaders hiding in the server room have been
defeated and you're still alive.


HINTS:

* Technicians (with a distinctive uniform) carry the
  bomb defusing instructions. As they see you they
  try to run away - it might be hard to find them
  again if you let them go!

* Try to sneak up on an enemy from behind.

* Conserve ammunition by punching or whipping unarmed
  activists. Silent methods of attack will not attract
  enemies as much as gunfire & explosions.

* The crossbow is at its best when enemies haven't
  noticed you yet.

* Use grenades & bazooka with caution: they can cause
  much damage, also to you!

* The scanner (if you find it) will show nearby
  activists (RED color), computers (GREEN color)
  and collectable items (YELLOW colors). You can
  not use any weapons while using it, and its battery
  will deplete quickly when used.

* If an enemy drops a first aid kit and you're already
  at full health, try to remember the place - you'll
  need it later... Same goes for ammunition (there's
  a certain maximum of bullets you can carry.)

* Every time you go up/down stairs reduces time by
  10 seconds. So try to plan your route with minimal
  floor changes, or use lifts.

* Be prepared when you enter the server room - the
  leaders might have powerful weaponry.

* If you win, bonus is awarded for survived computers.
  Servers are considered valuable, so try to persuade
  the leaders to exit the server room and combat them
  outside.

* If you defuse a bomb without instructions (by
  guessing) you receive a large bonus. However, this
  is not recommended...
