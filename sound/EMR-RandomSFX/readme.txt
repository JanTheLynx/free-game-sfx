I worked on these as test sounds about a year ago.  Some of them are okay, others not so much.  I'm sure someone somewhere needs a missile or laser or random interface click, so here you go.


Pew Pew -
A whole bunch of variations on the kind of sound you'd hear in a typical sci fi.  Based on, if I remember right, the sound of a water/rubber ball bouncing on a hollow wood floor.


Hits -
Things that sound like things hitting other things.



Rocket -
For the record, I've seen plenty of small rockets (I launched model rockets when I was a kid), and they do sound pretty much like "woosh" (if I remember correctly, and thats admittedly a big 'if').
