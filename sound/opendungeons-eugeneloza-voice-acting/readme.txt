Sketch voice acting I made for Open Dungeons, features:

A drunken dwarf, a Hero advisor, two Dungeon Keepers, an evil snake and a toady imp :)
Plus a bonus: neutral computer.

This will also do for many fantasy-style strategy projects :)

File format:
WAV 48000/32 bit
OGG 44100/16 bit

- DWARF: 29 phrases
- HERO: 46 phrases
- KEEPER (GROAN): 47 phrases
- KEEPER (NEUTRAL): 38 phrases
- SNAKE: 47 phrases
- TOADY: 31 phrases
- COMPUTER: 42 phrases

Phrases fall into the following categories:
- Greeting
- Victory
- Defeat

- You have met an objective
- You have a new objective
- You have failed one of your objectives
- Creature cannot create a bed
- Creature is hungry and cannot find food

The Voice Acting will be improved (re-recorded) as soon as improved script will be made. See http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=6042 for details. Some of the files contain minor recording artefacts denoted with # tag in filename.

P.S. If you want some of *your* phrases also to be recorded, write a comment with specific requrest before I do re-recording (planned for late-January 2015).
