Here's the first of the 3 games I had available for the open bundle that Nick Liow put together.
Sorry it's taking me so long to get them on Opengameart, but alot of the animations were made using  parts made up of movieClips so exporting them into a sprite sequence is proved really time consoming. 

But heres the first one Its all the Art, sprites, background art, sound effects, and music loops used in Da Pink Knight.

So theres Png sequences of
The Pink Knight
Giant Mech clockwork knight
small minion knight
explosions and other effects.

Just stating this for the record this is not associated with CastleCrashers or Behemoth in anyway. 

once I have the free time I will be converting the other two game  assets into png files and uploading here.
