"The things that are part of the website repository are indeed AGPLv3 unless otherwise specified on a per file base.
There are some libraries in that repository you found that may be licensed differently. This mostly applies to any *.jar file with embedded license information.

The graphics you found on the website are left overs someone forgot to remove. If you want to use the graphics there, feel free to do so. But we are not using that format any more.
The ITX files are as far as I remember simply the uncompressed RGBA textures as they are send into the OpenGL driver. Very simple format.

The newer versions of the client use simple PNGs. I guess there is not much of a point creating a new decoder for that. :wink:

AGPLv3 mostly allows you to do what ever you want with the sources. But we are always thankful for any credits to our project.
And good luck with your project. :)

Best regards,
Nitram"
