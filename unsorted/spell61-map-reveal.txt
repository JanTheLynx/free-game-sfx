An attempt to recreate the "Sight of Evil" sfx from Dungeon Keeper (TWINKLE.WAV). To produce this sound I have used Audacity's paulstrech applied to a synth whoosh sample, spiced with some glitter. The metallic radio tuning sound was drawn manually in SpectraLayer.

It uses following public domain samples.
