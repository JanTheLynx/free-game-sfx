Interkarma and everyone over at the Daggerfall Workshop (dfworkshop.net)

The Lowpoly Coop (lowpolycoop.com), DH uses models from their Tavern
and Armoury packs.

Thermite 3D (http://www.thermite3d.org) for CMake files which automate
finding a number of OGRE dependencies. Many of our CMake files have
been based off of these.

Freegamer, the man and the site (http://freegamer.blogspot.com). Both
do great things for the FOSS gaming community.

OpenMW (http://openmw.sf.net) for intercooperation and moral
support. The project shares many of the same goals with DH, so is worth
checking out!

The Daggerwind Scrolls (http://daggerwind.sf.net) for moral
support. Another similar project worth checking out if you run Mac OS X.

To all the authors of the wonderful FOSS libraries that we are using:
OGRE 3D
Python
Bullet Physics
MyGUI
OpenAL (Soft) and ALURE
Open Input System
OggVorbis
CMake
SWIG
BtOgre
Paged Geometry Plugin
