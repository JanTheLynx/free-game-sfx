1. Introduction
netPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game designed for FAST
ACTION combat. Gameplay concentrates on the core -- no resource management is
needed. The game is based on quick tactical action and unit management in
real-time. Battles progress quickly and constantly as destroyed players respawn
with a set of new units. Players can join or leave multiplayer games at any
time.

1.1 A bit of history
The original development of netpanzer was done from PyroSoft inc. Though in
1999 they stop development and released the game 2002 in GPL and it was nearly
forgotten, until Ingo announce it at happypenguin.org. Soon after this
announcement a group of coders did the linux port in roughly 2 weeks, with
another 2 weeks polishing for this release. Now we'll go along and improve the
game...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Building and Installation

2.1 Prerequesites
The game depends on some tools and libraries to be present, before you can start
building it. Here's a list of them:

* normal gnu compiler and additional tools (g++ version 3.2 or later is
  required at the moment)

* SCons build tool
  http://www.scons.org/

* SDL 1.2.5 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org

* SDL_mixer 1.2.4 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

* subversion (needed to download the source code)
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

Thanks to all the authors of these helpful libraries that made our development
easy and straightforward.

To download the code use the subversion client to download from
  svn://svn.berlios.de/netpanzer/tags/netpanzer/<wanted_version>

An explample for version 0.8.3 would be:
  svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/netpanzer/tags/netpanzer/0.8.3 netpanzer

Note that I use "export" instead of "checkout" to avoid having all the ".svn"
folders spread over the source. This is interesting for Linux distributions.

2.2 Building without installing on non Windows

To build the game and run as normal user do the following:

# scons

When scons finish without errors the game is ready to play, type this:

# ./netpanzer

Remember that next time you want to play you have to go to the same folder where
you compiled and type './netpanzer'

2.3 Building on Windows

Building on windows is a little bit more complicated, developers shouldn't have
any big problem.

MinGW should be installed in C:\mingw

Get the development libraries of SDL for mingw32, copy the include directory to
C:\mingw\include\SDL so you have the file "C:\mingw\include\SDL\SDL.h", and the
lib folder to C:\mingw\lib

Get SDL_mixer development libraries for VC8, copy the header file to
C:\mingw\include\SDL and the .lib file to c:\mingw\lib

Python and scons should be installed and working.

To compile netpanzer run scons on the folder where you have the netpanzer source
code:

C:\Some\Folder\With\Netpanzer> scons

After scons finish without errors you have to copy all the .DLL files from SDL
and from SDL_mixer to the netpanzer folder.

To run you can type 'netpanzer' or click on the netpanzer.exe file in explorer.

2.4 Building for distribution on non Windows operating systems

If you plan to distribute NetPanzer for installation (on Linux systems, for example)
there are some extra steps to be taken care.

NetPanzer needs to know where the data files will be stored when the game runs. To
set this data you have to add the parameter "datadir=/some/dir/" at compile time
and NetPanzer will look there for its data files. Example:

# scons datadir=/usr/local/games/netpanzer

Using the sample line, after NetPanzer is built, it will look in /usr/local/games/netpanzer
for it's data files.

For versioning, there is a file called "RELEASE_VERSION", the first line on that file will
be the version that NetPanzer will show. You can use that file to change the version of
the game shown. You should modify the file before compilation.

Actually there is no install script, you will have to prepare the script by yourself.
The installation is actually easy, and you only have to copy several files. The following
directories should be copied on the "datadir" destination:
- cache/
- fonts/
- maps/
- pics/
- powerups/
- scripts/
- sound/
- units/
- wads/

If you want to copy some documentation, the "doc" folder has it. There is also the BUGS,
COPYING, ChangeLog, README (this file), RELNOTES and TODO.

"netpanzer.desktop" is a sample file for using on desktop systems.

"netpanzer.png" and "netpanzer.xpm" are some sample icons to be use with the game.

And of course, the file "netpanzer" is the main binary that should be on the PATH.

2.5 Music

Netpanzer doesn't come with own musicfiles yet. However you can place your
favourite .mp3, .ogg or .mod files into the sound/music directory and netpanzer
will play these in random order while you play.

2.6 Starting the game

You can start the game in several ways:

If you compiled yourself NetPanzer (and didn't install), first "cd" to the folder where
you compiled it and type:
# ./netpanzer

If NetPanzer was installed and is in the PATH, type
# netpanzer

It is possible that in your distribution NetPanzer was installed and has a menu item,
if that is the case, just click on the item.

On Windows, you can click on the "netpanzer.exe" file.

This section needs to be written... Press F1 in the game for a quick overview of
keys and in general trust your intuition :)

4. Dedicated Server and Configuration Files

Note: This has to be reviewed.

You can start a dedicated netpanzer server (a pure server, without any video
output). By starting netpanzer with the -d commandline option.

The server reads the configuration from
    $HOME/.netpanzer/config/netpanzer-dedicated.ini
The format is basically the same as the normal configuration file of
netpanzer. Here's a short introduction into the option specific to a server in
the server section of the file:

*serverport [number], default 3030
    Specifies the port which the server will be using.
    (The server is doing both, TCP and UDP connections on this port)

*bindaddress [string], default ""
    Allows you to bind the server to a specific IP address (usefull if you have
    multiple IP addresses on 1 box)

*logging [yes,no], default no
    When enabled the server creates detailed logs about the matches in the
    $HOME/logs directory. This can be usefull for creating statistics about the
    matches.

*public [yes,no], default yes
    Register at the internet masterservers so that the server will appear in the
    serverlist of other players.

*maxplayers [number], default 8
    Number of players and bots that are able to play simultaneously on the
    server.

*mapcycle [name], default "Cramped, Tight Quarters, Two Villages"
    A comma separated list of maps that this server will use.

*maxunits [number], default 500
    Number of maximum available units for all players. (Each
            player will be able to have maxplayers/maxunits units at once)
    
*gametype [0,1,2], default 0
    Type of game: (0=Objectives, 1=FragLimit, 2=TimeLimit)

*timelimit [number], default 50
    timelimit of the map in minutes (used when gametype = 2)

*fraglimit [number], default 500
    fraglimit of the map (used when gametype=1)

*objectivepercentage [number], default 50
    Percentage of outposts that has to be captured to win the game.
    (used when gametype=0)

*mapcycling [yes,no], default no
    cycle to next map after a map ended.

*powerups [yes,no], default yes
    enable/disable powerups

*allowallies [yes,no], default yes
    allow/disallow players to allie

*cloudcoverage [number], default 65
    Number of clouds flying over the map.

*windspeed [number], default 30
    windspeed that affects particles and clouds

*respawntype [0,1], default 1
    Spawn mode: 0=Round Robin, 1=Random

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. Bot Players

Bot players can be spawn only on the dedicated server. To do that enter the 
server console and type:
> addbot

A new bot will appear on the game. Type help on the server console for more
info and commands.
