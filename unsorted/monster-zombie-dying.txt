"Most files in the orignal pauliuw's release had been damaged with analog noise buzz, which I have cleaned up completely using SpectraLayers Pro.

This file ("Dieing Beast.wav") had what appears to be noise filterd clicks, but they were still hearable, so I have cleaned them completely." -- Nikita Sadkov
