# Introduction
############################################################

Wyrmsun is an open-source RTS game which features elements of mythology, history and fiction.

In the Wyrmsun universe a myriad of inhabited planets exist. Humans dwell on Earth, while dwarves inhabit Nidavellir and elves nourish the world of Alfheim. These peoples struggle to carve a place for themselves with their tools of stone, bronze and iron. And perhaps one day they will meet one another, beyond the stars...

Features:
- Retro-style graphics
- 2 playable civilizations, and a number of non-playable ones
- 23 quests to play, earning technology points which can be used to obtain new units, buildings and technologies
- Dozens of units, buildings and technologies
- Personal names and traits for units
- Units can earn experience, being able to upgrade to new unit types or acquire new abilities upon level-up
- Persistent heroes, who carry over their level, abilities and items throughout scenarios
- Possibility to create your own custom persistent heroes
- Normal, magic-enchanted and unique items drop from enemies
- Very moddable game, with a built-in mod editor and Steam Workshop integration
- Grand strategy mode, where production is resolved on the strategic (world map) level, while battles are resolved on the tactical level
- In-game encyclopedia, allowing players to learn more about the units, buildings and other elements of the game, as well as their historical and mythological sources of inspiration

Wyrmsun's lore is based on history and mythology, and on the lore of other open-source fantasy games, such as Battle for Wesnoth.

Getting Wyrmsun on Steam (http://store.steampowered.com/app/370070) provides you with benefits such as streamlined installation, automatic updates and Steam Workshop integration.
