# Introduction
############################################################

Wyrmsun is an open-source RTS game which features elements of mythology, history and fiction.

In the Wyrmsun universe a myriad of inhabited planets exist. Humans dwell on Earth, while dwarves inhabit Nidavellir and elves nourish the world of Alfheim. These peoples struggle to carve a place for themselves with their tools of stone, bronze and iron. And perhaps one day they will meet one another, beyond the stars...

Features:
- Retro-style graphics
- 2 playable civilizations, and a number of non-playable ones
- 23 quests to play, earning technology points which can be used to obtain new units, buildings and technologies
- 38 units, 30 buildings and 21 technologies
- Units can earn experience, being able to upgrade to new unit types or acquire new abilities upon level-up
- Persistent heroes, who carry over their level and abilities throughout scenarios
- Personal names and traits for units
- Cave, Conifer Forest, Dungeon, Fairlimbed Forest and Swamp tilesets
- 37 maps of real and fictional locations to choose from, as well as random maps
- Living environment, with fauna reproduction and predation
- Very moddable game, with mod-loading capability built in
- Grand strategy mode, where production is resolved on the strategic (world map) level, while battles are resolved on the tactical level
- In-game encyclopedia, allowing players to learn more about the units, buildings and other elements of the game, as well as their historical and mythological sources of inspiration

Wyrmsun's lore is based on history and mythology, and on the lore of other open-source fantasy games, such as Battle for Wesnoth.

Getting Wyrmsun on Steam (http://store.steampowered.com/app/370070) provides you with benefits such as streamlined installation, automatic updates and Steam Workshop integration.
