Sound effects
=============

- intro.wav

  Original/replaced version: Used to be the soundtrack of the game
  intro video (CD version); replaced by empty sound since 1.08. Used
  for "Back from the grave" title screen.

  Replacement:
  It's just a 1-frame silence, nothing copyrightable ;)

- fire.wav

  Fire burning in the background (chimney, torch)

  Replacement:

  License: CC-BY 3.0

  Edited to match the original length and frequency, and reworked
  (bass/equilizer) to better match the original sound.  It was done
  using Audacity, but given the manual processing, there was no real
  source form and I trashed the temporary .aup project.
  Copyright (C) 2008  Sylvain Beucler

- open.wav

  Door opening (unfortunately without a nice squeaking).

  Source taken from:
  http://opengameart.org/content/door-open-door-close

  Recorded with a Zoom H2 portable recorder, cleaned up (fade in/out)
  in Audacity. Sox was used to convert the sound to match the format
  of the original sound.

  Choir noise when you pickup a strength potion; sound when you're
  given control when starting the game

  Recreated with ZynAddSubFX, with instrument "Choir and Voice > Choir
  Pad1", notes are g+2+7 on ZynAddSubFX, i.e FA# (bass) + DO# (bass) +
  SIb (high), or F#+C#+Cb (US).

  Girl scream (e.g. when you hit Chealse, the girl near the well in
  the first village).  Also played at very low rate in Lyna's Story
  for the Dead Dragon Carcass scene.

  Performed by Maria Carmona Varo, recorded by Fernando Carmona Varo.
  The .wav version is edited to make it a bit less loud, and with
  efforts to reduce the "wind" of the micro.

  Edited: the original sound was too long; using Audacity (gold.aup),
  I truncated the sound and applied a fade_out to diminish the
  truncation effect.

  in my opinion it's not that big deal.

  Sword hitting something non-metallic, but also used at high rate
  (22050Hz) to produce the 'Dink picks a small heart' sound

  Origin: wesnoth/data/core/sounds/spear.ogg
  Author: ?
  License: GPLv2+

  Edited: added kind of a reversed and shortened echo after the
  hitting sound.  Sounds ok played faster as a 'pick-something-up'
  sound too. I'm not fully satisfied with this, but I did my best :).
  Copyright (C) 2010  Petteri Tolonen
  License: GPLv2+

  Edited: I made this sound earlier, but it started to annoy me, so I
  modified the "echo" part to be a little bit "crunchier".
