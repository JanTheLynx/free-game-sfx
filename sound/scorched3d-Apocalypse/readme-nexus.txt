hNexus 6's map packs for Scorched 3D
===================================

These maps are intended for use with the completely and utterly awesome
Scorched 3D game, written by Gavin Camp and his merry minions. Go visit 

    http://scorched3d.co.uk/ 

now if you haven't already acquired this masterpiece.

This package contains:

README             - this thing you are reading
LICENSE            - legal stuff
landscapes.xml     - the XML description for the levels which needs to be
                     merged into your own landscapes.xml.

Then the maps themselves, which are 256x256 BMP images in 24 bit colour,
and their companion pictures.

These maps are entirely my own work. That's actually an important fact
because it gives me the right to allow distribution of them. As there is
absolutely no point in keeping these scribblings of mine to myself
(especially as most of the fun is playing on these maps against other real
people), I hearby give you the opportunity to download and share them
amongst yourselves. To put this on a slightly clearer legal footing, read
the attached license in the LICENSE file. The license says, in rather more
words, that you may take these files, alter them, redistribute them and
play around with them as long as you acknowledge my original work somewhere
somehow...



Here is the human readable version of the license. If you are a lawyer or
just like reading legal documents, take a look at the contents of the
LICENSE file.
