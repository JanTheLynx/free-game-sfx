Original release by Eddies was in 32bit float, which I have converted to 16bit. To keep filesizes manageable.

"Hey OpenGameArt,

This is my first release and I hope you guys will like it. Took me a few hours to make, since I couldn't find anything like tis around here or on any other website I decided to make my own for my own game.

You can use it, free of charge, credits aren't neccesary but are definitely appreciated. If you want to, leaving a friendly comment will always help.

This is the first audio pack of any sorts that I've made, let alone making it for a game or with my own voice - so please, don't judge it too hard!

If you want to know anything about this pack, contact me, or whatnot you can always go to my website at www.itseddie.com, there should be a link to my Steam profile - and we can go from there.

This pack contains about 70 unique lines with an alien type voice. All the files are (.wav in 32 bit, not sure if that's good or decent) open for you to convert to any format.

I've sadly accidently closed my notepad and currently do not have the time to format them all properly in here for a description - if anyone is willing to do that - thank you!

Best Regards,

 - Eddie

I do not own the preview picture. It is a Scrin Eradicator from the command and conquer 3 series.
