In 2015, we worked on a game that never came out. It was a very diverse project, and we composed music for many situations in many styles, including ambient music . In addition, we wanted to release a nice OST (Original Sound Track), which obviously never came out.

As the game will never be released, we decided to provide you with all the material we produced for free, so you can use it in your own projects. All we ask is to credit us if you use something.

We put much effort on the album and we were feeling a great need to make it available to everyone, then it would be very nice to hear what you guys think of it.
