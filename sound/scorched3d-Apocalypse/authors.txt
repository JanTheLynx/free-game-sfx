This is a listing of all the players who have made contributions to the mod (whether they know it or not).
If there is anything that you think I may have used in the mod that was originally done by you and your
name does not appear in the list below, please send an e-mail to bobirov@yahoo.com stating your name and
the content that is in question.  I don't want to leave anyone out, and I am sorry if I have not listed you.

	- Gavin Camp
		- Made it all possible and has implemented many, many things in the game which were not necessary to recreate Scorched Earth but have made it possible to create so much more.  Without his deligence and attention to his user base, most of this mod would not be possible.  Thank you so much.
