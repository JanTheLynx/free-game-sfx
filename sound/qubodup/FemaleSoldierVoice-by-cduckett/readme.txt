These are voice samples thought to be used in real time strategy or role playing games, where build and movement commands are issued to different units/heroes. There is a long raw recording (mp3), one radio-effect-edited version (mp3) and two cut up sample packs (flac, 5 voice samples in each set), one of which has truck/explosion background sounds to match the situation.

Sound modifications described in readme files as well. Radio voice tutorial shows the method that was used to add the radio effect.
