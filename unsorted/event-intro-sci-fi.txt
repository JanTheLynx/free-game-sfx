A THX inspired fanfare made on a Yamaha Clavinova CVP-85A using the Cosmic 1 patch, sequenced in Cakewalk Pro Audio 8 using multiple tracks with different keys, expression and pan curves, and pitch bends.
Although not so professional-sounding, it has quite the flavor, texture and "spacy-ness". Enjoy :)
