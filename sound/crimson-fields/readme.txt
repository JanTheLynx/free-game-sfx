Crimson Fields is a turn-based tactical war game. It can be played against a human opponent in hot-seat mode in front of the same machine, over a network, or via e-mail, or against the computer. 

The game comes with tools for creating custom maps and campaigns, and a converter for maps from the classic games Battle Isle and History Line.
