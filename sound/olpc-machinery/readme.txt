These are ambient machine sounds, suitable for use in sci-fi environments, from the OLPC archive.  Complete attribution info is:

A collection of sounds that have been selected, organized and prepared for OLPC by Dr. Richard Boulanger (a.k.a. Dr.B.). From 1999 - 2007, these samples were recorded in The Berklee Studios and on location in and around Boston under the supervision of Associate Professor Michael Brigida by over 250 Music Synthesis majors taking his Advanced Sampling Class at The Berklee College of Music. Editing and trimming these original, long, and often meandering recordings into usable individual samples was done by Music Synthesis students - Diane Douglas and Colman O'Reilly.
