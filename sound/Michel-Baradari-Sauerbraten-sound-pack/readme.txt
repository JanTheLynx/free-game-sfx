Hello my name is Michel, I am a sounddesigner from germany. I am really surprised how cube has evolved. Sauerbraten looks really awesome now. However i think the sounds are a bit stale and do not fit anymore to the new look. So i decided to create new sounds for Sauerbraten. I recorded a lot of things and created new sounds by myself. After two weeks of hard working I have finally finished it. I think the sounds fit perfectly now and i hope you like it too. 

The soundpack contains 66 new selfmade sounds and the edited sounds.cfg file. You have to extract it into the sauerbraten folder.For the optimal sound quality you have to change the sound frequency to 44100 Hz.

If you find any bugs or if I forgot any important sound, please tell me.

Have Fun!
