I've isolated the sound effects and voice out of "final mix", which is CC-BY (according to Ton Roosendaal) and CC-BY does allow editing such licensed sounds.

"Here is the official stance: the individual sound effect files and the music itself (without sound effects) have not been licensed as CC-BY. Only the complete works was, the final mix." --Ton Roosendaal
